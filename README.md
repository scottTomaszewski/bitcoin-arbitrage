Note, this example is real, it has happened when the blockchain
forked. MtGox is a very reactive market, price dropped significally in
1 hour, this kind of situation opens very good arbitrage
opportunities with slower exchanges.

To check your balance on an exchange (also a good way to check your accounts configuration):

    $ python3 arbitrage.py -m MtGoxEUR get-balance
    $ python3 arbitrage.py -m MtGoxEUR,MtGoxUSD,BitstampUSD get-balance

Run tests
